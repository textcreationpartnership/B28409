            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PROCEEDINGS UPON The Bayling The L. <hi>Brondon Gerrard, Rich. Hambden</hi> Jun. Esq; <hi>Joh. Trenchard,</hi> Esq; <hi>Fr. Charlton</hi> the Elder, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Wildman,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hen. Booth,</hi> Esq; lately Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower,</hi> as Persons concerned in the late Conspiracy against the Life of the King, and to Subvert the Government, who were the 28th of this Instant <hi>November,</hi> 1683. Bailed before the Judges of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Discharged from their Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the <hi>Tower,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>UPon or soon after the late Discovery of a Design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Life of his Majesty, and to Subvert the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished Government of this Kingdom, amongst other Persons, The Lord <hi>Brandon Gerard, R. Hambden</hi> Junior, Esq; <hi>J. Trenchard</hi> of <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Sumerset-shire,</hi> Esq; Major <hi>Wildman, F. Charlton</hi> the Elder; and <hi>H. Booth,</hi> Esq; being apprehended, were after some Examination Committed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to the Tower, when as no Prosecution being made against them, they according as the Statute of his present Majesty, made for the Preservation of the Liberty of the Subject, directs by their Council, moved at the Bar of the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> that they might have their <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> to be brought into that Court in order to their being Bailed, which upon the said Motion was granted, The <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> being directed to the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the Tower to bring them up as this Day. When between 8 and 9 in the Morning, they were brought in Coaches attended by a strong Guard of Souldiers, and of the <hi>Lieutenants</hi> Servants, and
<pb facs="tcp:189573:2"/>about 9, the Court sitting, they were Introduced, and made it their Request they might be Bailed, whereupon they were informed that they might be admitted to Bail, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the first day of the next Term, and so <hi>dies in diem</hi> till they should be discharged by due Course of Law. When <hi>R. Hambden,</hi> Esq; was further informed, there was an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Misdemeanour</hi> Preferred against him; to which he must Plead before he could be admitted to Bail, whereupon he desired that he might be Bailed, and that he would appear, and Plead to it the next Term, but he was informed that it could not be done, and the Kings Council insisting that he might be obliged to Plead before Bail was taken, after silence was made, the Clark of the Crown bid him hold up his Hand, which he doing the Indictment was Read, Importing that he, <hi>viz. R. Hambden,</hi> Esq; contrary to his Duty, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, had consulted with divers Evil minded People in order to raise Commotions to stir up Sedition and the Ancient Government of this Kingdom to Subvert, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which he Pleaded not Guilty, and thereupon was ordered to produce his Bail, which he did, <hi>viz.</hi> Four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality, who entered into Recognizances of 5000 l. a piece, and himself into a Recognizance of 10000 l. to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the First Day of the next Term, and so day by day▪ <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Into the like Recognizances entered the Lord <hi>Brandon Gerard,</hi> and <hi>J. Trenchard,</hi> Esq; each producing Persons of great Worth, after which <hi>F. Charlton</hi> the Elder, Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> and <hi>H. Booth,</hi> Esq; were ordered to name their Respective Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they did, and they being accepted by Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny General on the part of the King, Entered into Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances of 1000 l. a piece, and the Principals respectively into double the Sum to Appear as aforesaid, each of them giving Sureties as in such Cases is Required, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lieutenant of the Tower being Discharged of his Prisoners, the Guards were sent away, and they left Intirely at their Liberty, when having payed their Respects, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own Servants, they depart the Court.</p>
